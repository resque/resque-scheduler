      # Hash keys can be anything and are used to describe and reference
      # the scheduled job. If the "class" argument is missing, the key
      # is used implicitly as "class" argument - in the "MakeTea" example,
      # "MakeTea" is used both as job name and resque worker class.
      #
      # Any jobs that were in the old schedule, but are not
      # present in the new schedule, will be removed.
      #
      # :cron can be any cron scheduling string
      #
      # :every can be used in lieu of :cron. see rufus-scheduler's 'every'
      # usage for valid syntax. If :cron is present it will take precedence
      # over :every.
      #
      # :class must be a resque worker class. If it is missing, the job name
      # (hash key) will be used as :class.
      #
      # :args can be any yaml which will be converted to a ruby literal and
      # passed in a params. (optional)
      #
      # :rails_env is the list of envs where the job gets loaded. Envs are
      # comma separated (optional)
      #
      # :description is just that, a description of the job (optional). If
      # params is an array, each element in the array is passed as a separate
      # param, otherwise params is passed in as the only parameter to
      # perform.
